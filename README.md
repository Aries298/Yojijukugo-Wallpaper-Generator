# Setup
To correctly setup the script you need to use files found in the "additional files" folder.
Note that the guide is made for the Windows 10 and may differ from other OS.
#### Step 1
Edit the "change wallpaper.bat" file and replace "PATH_TO_MAIN_FILE" with the path of script's main file.

#### Step 2
Open the startup folder by running shell:startup and move "change wallpaper.vbs" file there. Edit the file and replace PATH_TO_BAT_FILE with the path fo the .bat file.
